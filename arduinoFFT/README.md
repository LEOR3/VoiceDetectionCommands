Fast Fourier Transform for Arduino

Arduino FFT Library by Enrique Condes (kosme), you can download it directly in arduino IDE library manager, if you are being use this IDE. https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT.git

In this version of the library, I add different functions that are used in the VoiceDetection code.
