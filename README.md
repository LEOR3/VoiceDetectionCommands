# Voice Detection Commands with FFT in ESP32

## **Voice Detection With 3 Saved Commands**

This project has been created with the porpuse of savingh 3 commands that can be said into the microphone connected to the microcontroller, to later identified these saved commands if it necessary, in this project the commands are identified with the  corresponding saved command number and its displayed in a OLED.

In this project is used:

1.- ESP32 Microcontroller

2.- Arduino FFT Library by Enrique Condes (kosme), you can download it directly in arduino IDE library manager, if you are being use this IDE.
    https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT.git

3.- Microphone  (KY-038)

4.- OLED 128X64 

5.- 1 Button (To saved commands only when is pushed the button)

6.- 2 Extra Buttons (If you need the 2 pages that are included in this project)
